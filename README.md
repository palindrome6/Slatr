# Slatr: Your own personal privacy sensitive language translation app
## Why did we build this app?
We've always been a bit skeptical when using Google translate. We often have to translate emails or text containing sensitive information. What really happens when you enter something on Google translate? Google probably stores this data and maybe even uses this information for adverts? We don't really know. We would rather put our efforts to building our own translator than share sensitive data with Google. 

The result of this concern is Slatr. It is a pretty basic translator. We use the M2M100 multilingual machine translation (MMT) model from Facebook using Huggingface transformers. This app uses a React front-end and a Flask back-end. 

We plan to host this at some point (link will be added soon).
